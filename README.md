# Gradient Descent: Implementations and explanations of optimization techniques such as gradient descent and its variations (stochastic gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent, etc.).

 This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates gradient descent optimization on a machine learning model. You can find detailed explanations of how the algorithm works, visualizations of the optimization process, and results on different datasets.
Housing Price Prediction: Using the Ames Housing dataset, this assignment applies machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict housing prices based on various features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and neighborhood.
